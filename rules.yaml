# These two notations are equivalent:
# exampleprop: [ref, x, d, ref]
# exampleprop:
#   patterns: ['^exampleprop$']
#   struct: [ref, x, d, ref]
#
# If property name matches pattern, struct is applied for dereferencing phandles
# If no struct is given, consider struct is dynamic:
#  - first element is a ref
#  - if property being parsed is named 'clock', then number of cells is indicated by '#clock-cells' property of referenced object
#  - cells follow ref and are kept as numbers
#  - after cells comes next ref
clock:
  patterns: ['^clocks$']
gpio:
  patterns: ['^gpios?$', '-gpios?']
pinctrl:
  patterns: ['^pinctrl-']
  struct: [ref]
rockchip,pins: [d, d, d, ref]
